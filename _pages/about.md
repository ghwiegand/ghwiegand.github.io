I am a phd candidate and research assistant at [DS-NLP Lab](https://blog.nlp-lab.ai/) in the [Chair of Data Science and Natural Language Processing of Prof. Siegfried Handschuh](https://ics.unisg.ch/chairs/siegfried-handschuh-data-science-and-natural-language-processing/) at University of St.Gallen (HSG).

My research focusses on foundation model training and optmizitaion. I am also the Teaching Assistant for Statistics for Data Scientists (CS Bachleor 3. Semester) and "NLP with LLM" class (CS Master 2. Semester). Aside that I also suppervise master and bachelor thesis and other projects.

## Papers 
- **A Convexity-Dependent Two-Phase Training Algorithm for Deep Neural Networks**
  - Tomas Hrycej, Bernhard Bermeitinger, Massimo Pavone, Götz-Henrik Wiegand, Siegfried Handschuh
  - ORCID: [0009-0009-0392-056X](https://orcid.org/0009-0009-0392-056X) | arXiv: [2510.25366](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25366) | DOI: [10.5220/0013696100004000](https://doi.org/10.5220/0013696100004000)
  - *KDIR IC3K 2025 (Best Paper Award)*
  - **TLDR:** Proposes a two-phase optimization algorithm that detects when the loss landscape transitions from non-convex to convex regions, switching from Adam to Conjugate Gradient to substantially improve convergence speed and accuracy.

- **Leveraging Generative AI for Enhancing Domain-Driven Software Design**
  - Götz-Henrik Wiegand, Filip Stepniak, Patrick Baier
  - ORCID: [0009-0009-0392-056X](https://orcid.org/0009-0009-0392-056X) | arXiv: [2601.20909](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20909) | DOI: [10.60643/URAI.V2024P41](https://doi.org/10.60643/URAI.V2024P41)
  - *URAI 2024*
  - **TLDR:** Demonstrates that a 4-bit quantized Code Llama fine-tuned with LoRA on a consumer GPU can generate syntactically correct domain-specific JSON objects for Domain-Driven Design, partially automating metamodel creation.
