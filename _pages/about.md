I am a phd candidate and research assistant at [DS-NLP Lab](https://blog.nlp-lab.ai/) in the [Chair of Data Science and Natural Language Processing of Prof. Siegfried Handschuh](https://ics.unisg.ch/chairs/siegfried-handschuh-data-science-and-natural-language-processing/) at University of St.Gallen (HSG).

My research focusses on foundation model training and optmizitaion. I am also the Teaching Assistant for Statistics for Data Scientists (CS Bachleor 3. Semester) and "NLP with LLM" class (CS Master 2. Semester). Aside that I also suppervise master and bachelor thesis and other projects.
